# 🐢 TurtleRace Game – Python Turtle Module

Welcome to the **Turtle Race** game built using Python's `turtle` module. This is a fun graphical program where colored turtles race across the screen, and the user bets on the winning color!

---

## 🎯 Objective

Predict the color of the turtle that will win the race and see if your guess is correct! A simple yet engaging way to learn graphical programming with Python.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **Turtle Graphics Module** (built-in)

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The player is prompted to choose a color (e.g., red, blue, green).
2. Multiple turtles start from the left side of the screen.
3. Each turtle moves forward a random distance at each turn.
4. The first turtle to reach the finish line wins the race.
5. The program tells you if your prediction was correct.

## ▶️ Run the Game

  1. **Clone this repository**
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/ayush080603/TurtleRace.git
      cd TurtleRace
  2. **Make sure you have pygame installed:**
      ```bash
      pip install pygame
  3. **Run the Python file**
      ```bash
      python turtle_race.py

## ✅ No external library needed – turtle is a built-in module in Python.

## 🎓 Learning Outcome

This project helps reinforce:
- Using loops and conditionals
- Working with Python’s turtle module
- GUI-based interaction in CLI applications
- Handling user input and graphical animation
